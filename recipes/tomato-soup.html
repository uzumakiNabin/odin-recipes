    <h1>Tomato Soup</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my go-to tomato soup recipe. It's so easy and delicious. It's easily made vegan (if you 
        use margarine instead of butter or 2 tablespoons of olive oil), ready in 30 minutes, and I give
        leftovers to my kids for lunch. If you like, you can add cream, but my family likes it the way it is. 
        I usually serve it with rosemary bread for dunking.
